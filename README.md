# WineQualityPrediction
This project trains an ElasticNet regression model to predict red-wine quality from 11 numeric features, logs parameters/metrics (RMSE, MAE, RÂ²) and the model artifact with MLflow. It utilizes AWS EC2 Instance for running the MLflow server and S3 buckets to store the objects generated by the mlruns. 
<p>
STEPS:
<br>
Create an IAM user and configure credentials via aws configure<br> 
create an S3 bucket for artifacts
<br> launch an Ubuntu EC2 instance with port 5000 open
<br>install packages in the EC2 instance to deploy the MLFLOW tracking server in a virtual environment
<br>then run mlflow server -h 0.0.0.0 --default-artifact-root s3://<your-bucket> and set MLFLOW_TRACKING_URI=http://<EC2-Public-DNS>:5000 locally and in code.
<br>Run the app.py code from the client side to log the experiments in the remote EC2 server
